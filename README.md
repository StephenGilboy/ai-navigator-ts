# AI Navigator TS
Let AI help you with your playwright tests.

## Getting Started
The following tasks assume you've setup Playwright.

- Set an env variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY` to a valid OpenAI Key
- npm i
- npm run dev:server
- npm run dev:client

To try it up open the `src/client/index.ts` file and update the `task` variable.


## All it does is navigate to a website
Yeah. I still have some work to do but it's only day 1.
